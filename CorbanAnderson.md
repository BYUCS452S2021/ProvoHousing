# Application

Hello, I would be interested in working on this project because I have definitely been in your same boat of trying to find good housing in Provo! I was literally dreading coming into Winter semester because I needed to find housing for next fall and it is such a nightmare--luckily I think I was able to find a good spot but it should not be that difficult. As far as my technical background I've had experience working with postgres and with mongodb. But I also have experience with cloud tools including AWS EC2 servers, S3, and various web technologies including React, Vue, and Angular. I also have experience with Nodejs. If you would be interested in letting me work on this project please feel free to email me at corban@corbanha.com

## Bolts
- Business
   - The business side sounds good, we could also try a couple different business options for example we might try a percentage of the sale price versus a flat $10
- Operation
   - I worry about putting too much faith in a CEO to "grow the business" though we'll definitely want someone with some business background. We'll also want a COO, marketing officer, and social media/advertising expert.
- Legal
   - And if you legit want a Utah LLC I have experience. I have a couple Utah LLC's that I've created personally
- Technical
   - I think your technical looks good, users should have an account to post to avoid spam.
- Social
   - Socials look good, word of mouth will definitely be important for this app I think. If it had been a little earlier in the year, or for next year, we could take out an ad in the BYU Housing edition or even do a special deal with BYU Housing.
