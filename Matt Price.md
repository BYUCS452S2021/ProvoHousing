Hi!

I'd love to join this project. I've worked with SQL, noSQL and have taken a few classes on front end development.

This project interests me because it is something that I've been looking for and I think the project itself has a good description with not too many features to be considered "feature creep."

I'd love it if you got back to me at me@mattcprice.com if you're interested in working together.
