Hi!

I'd love to join this project. I've worked with SQL, noSQL and have taken a few classes on front end development.

This project interests me because it is something that I've been looking for and I think the project itself has a good description with not too many features to be considered "feature creep."

The business end I think is definitely the way to go. Adding ads and the possibility to sell contracts for a small fee to "promote" them to the front page or something like that.

For Operation, the idea that founders should operate the company is desirable, only change being keeping it an LLC as long as possible to limit liability. I don't think this company would grow past the need to be more than an established start-up though.

As soon as money is involved we would need to file for an LLC otherwise a Partnership or Sole Proprietor would work, but then it becomes a bit more messy.

As for accounts and posting on the technical side, accounts should be required for every action on the site, as well as different permissions so that we can have "verified" and "unverified" accounts to limit the amount of spam. The decisions that need to be made are what to include in the base schema, and if you want to add custom fields how to handle it if you don't use noSQL.

Word of mouth is the best way for this app to grow, so posting on Facebook and letting roommates know about it would definitely be required.

I'd love it if you got back to me at me@mattcprice.com if you're interested in working together.
