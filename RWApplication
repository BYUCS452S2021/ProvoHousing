Hello! My name is Reagan Weston, and I would love to join this project. I love the idea of an easy way to find housing in Provo. As a student who has previous lived in Provo, it can be a pain to find housing you like and that works with your lifestyle and preferences. This is an app I would have loved to use when I was looking for Provo housing, and I think it would be useful for a lot of people. I think a web-based app with mobile access is a great idea and will help the app reach the most people.

I have experience with backend programming, and some experience with SQL. I have worked a bit with frontend development in previous projects. I am an editing minor and have taken some design classes, so my current strengths in terms of frontend lie more with designing and compartmentalizing the layout and app structure. I still have a lot to learn in terms of implementation, but I am willing to put in the effort to learn in time with this project.

I agree with your business analysis. Ad support will help get the business going, and hopefully that would give the app enough reputation to begin charging posting fees, at which point registering as a business and hiring staff to help grow the business side would be necessary. This is a great goal to work towards, and I think achievable with this concept. Social outreach could be difficult in the beginning, but if we are able to find a niche in Facebook groups and other sites, I think our app would be able to reach the right people, and our social network would expand.

Again, I love the idea of this app, and I would be excited to join this project. Feel free to reach out to me on Slack, or email me at raygunrocks@gmail.com. Thank you!
